                        The majority of our challenges are free, yes.
                        We do have some that are premium and require a
                        <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro">Pro subscription</a> to access.
                        It will say on each challenge whether they are free or premium, so it's easy to tell the
                        difference.

                        so it's a great place to ask questions.
